Buttler acknowledged Sharma's clean ball striking and credited the Indian team for their remarkable performance. He mentioned the difficulty of stopping an on-fire player and appreciated England's effort despite the loss.  NEW DELHI: England captain Jos Buttler praised Abhishek Sharma for his incredible 54-ball 135 in India's 150-run victory in the fifth Twenty20 International in Mumbai. He called the record innings one of the best displays of \"clean ball striking.\" With 13 sixes, the most in an innings for any Indian player, and the second-fastest T20I century by an Indian hitter off 37 balls, Abhishek made history as he led the hosts to 247 for nine.\"Yeah, (we are) obviously disappointed (with the result), they (India) played a fantastic batting innings. I think credit to Abhishek Sharma, I thought that's as clean a ball striking as I've seen, I thought he played fantastically well,\" Buttler told the media after India recorded their second biggest T20I win by runs on Sunday.Buttler stated that his team had only two choices: either to go boom or bust. He denied that England were \"shell-shocked\" by Abhishek's assault on his bowlers.Also See: 2025 Champions Trophy | ICC Champions Trophy Fixtures 2025\"We always sit down and think what more could we have done or how we could have stopped him, but some days I think you have to give a lot of credit to the opposition, I thought he played brilliantly well,\" Buttler said.\"Shell-shocked's not quite the word, I think. It can be difficult sometimes when a player gets on a roll and they play as well as he did,\" Buttler said.\"Looking back at the last IPL, him and Travis Head were the same at the top of the order for Sunrisers (Hyderabad) and obviously he's brought that into India.\"\"He (Abhishek) played a brilliant innings and sometimes you want to credit the opposition. You always think of what more could you do, how could we get him out, how could we slow him down and, but yeah, credit to us for, you know, sticking in there and fighting back and keeping them down to 240 after the start they got,\" Buttler said.After the visitors were bowled out for 97 in 10.3 overs, with Phil Salt making a 23-ball 55, the England captain admitted that the pitch was still the same for his batters.\"I've played in a few games like this and it generally goes one of two ways, you either get actually somewhere near or you fall in a heap and today was that day,\" he said.\"The way Phil Salt went out there and struck the ball, it was obviously a really good wicket, you needed someone to go with him and one or two guys to catch fire and that's the way you're going to chase that down.\"Like I said, you either get quite close in games like this and surprise yourselves or it doesn't work but, no, we certainly won't change the way we want to play. We need to, you know, keep backing that, be even more committed and you're desperate to do well and execute that,\" he said.Buttler stated that following a 1-4 series loss to India, he would not want England to alter their style of play.\"We've had our moments actually in all the games bar the first one probably and today. We had moments in Chennai, Pune and obviously the game we won in Rajkot,\" he said.\"As we get more experienced, more committed to the style we want to play and the nuances of the game of how we're going to win those moments, then (we would) go on to win the match and win series,\" he added.Buttler added that Varun Chakravarthy, the spinner for India, was \"accurate\" during this series, taking 14 wickets.\"He's had a good series. He's been very accurate in his subtle variations and he's got a really good length, so he's done well,\" Buttler said.About the AuthorTOI Sports DeskThe TOI Sports Desk excels in a myriad of roles that capture the essence of live sporting events and deliver compelling content to readers worldwide.
