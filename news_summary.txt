Generated News Summary:
Good evening, and welcome back.  We begin tonight with highlights from India's dominant victory over England in the fifth T20 International.  India secured a 150-run triumph, largely thanks to a breathtaking performance by Abhishek Sharma.

Sharma blasted a record-breaking 135 runs off just 54 balls, smashing 13 sixes – the most ever by an Indian in a T20I innings.  England captain Jos Buttler was full of praise, calling Sharma's innings "as clean a ball striking as I've seen."  Buttler acknowledged the difficulty of containing such a dominant batsman, while also praising his team's fight despite the substantial loss.  Despite the defeat, Buttler emphasized that England wouldn't be changing their aggressive batting style.  The series concludes with a 4-1 win for India.  We'll have more on this story, including a closer look at Sharma’s incredible performance, later in the broadcast.
